            <p style="font-family:Arial;">The purpose of this scatter plot is to visualize the 
            relationship between the lack of access to healthcare and incidence of 
            poverty. Each bubble represents an invidual State. You can hover over any bubble to 
            to display the State name and the raw percentages of poverty and lack of healthcare.
            As you can there is a positive correlation between these two variables, the higher the percentage
            of poverty in a given state, the higher the percentage of those who lack healthcare. One can, generally,
            draw the conclusion that if an indivdual lives below the poverty line then that individual is more likely
            to not able to afford healthcare, however this conclusion does not explain everythig. There is something
            to be said about the fact that the Southern States, who have high percentages in both lack of healthcare 
            and poverty differ than some Northern States who score high in poverty but not lack of healthcare. 
            Perhaps, this is because they enforce higher State taxes, therefore they have more money to spend on 
            social programs that ameliorate lack of access to healthcare.
